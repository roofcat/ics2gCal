USAGE
=====

1) Create a configuration file named 'config' in the same directory as ics2gCal.
	 Tip: Use the layout provided below.

2) Create an empty file where UIDs of added events will be stored (named in the config file).

3) Run the script (./ics2gCal.py) either manually or by creating a cron job


USAGE WITHOUT ROOT ACCESS
=========================

If you don't have root access to the computer and need to install some of the dependencies you can
download the dependencies as usual, but instead of running

# ./setup.py install

you can run

$ ./setup.py install --home=~

This will install the Python module in ~, i.e. your home directory. Follow the USAGE section above as
usual, but when running the script you should make sure that your PYTHONPATH environment variable is set
to ~/lib/python/. The easiest way is to run the script with this command:

$ export PYTHONPATH=~/lib/python/ && ./ics2gCal.py


CONFIG FILE LAYOUT
==================

[calendar1]
url = <FILL IN>
sha1 = <FILL IN> #whatever as long as it isn't the actual sha1 of the ics file (will be updated)
addto = <FILL IN> #Calendar in gCal to add events to. If unsure, use /calendar/feeds/default/private/full>

[calendar2]
url = <FILL IN>
sha1 = <FILL IN>
addto = <FILL IN>

#etc...

[settings]
username = <FILL IN>@gmail.com
password = <FILL IN>
eventfile = addedEvents.txt
